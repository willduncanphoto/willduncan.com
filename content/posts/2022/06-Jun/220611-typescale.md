## Body Text

It really matters and then like it really doesn’t matter. What matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by it, it doesn’t matter. Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I’m here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too.

The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing out. But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you believe in what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed it?

I always felt like I could do anything. That’s the main thing people are controlled by! Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They're slowed down by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you can’t do anything, you won’t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.

## Ordered List

1. First list item
2. Second list item

5. Third list item

## Bullet List

## Code

You can add `inline` code. Or go big and post a block of code.

```
baseURL = 'https://willduncan.com'
languageCode = 'en-us'
timeZone = 'America/Los_Angeles'
```

## Quotes

> I don't know what's better, getting laid or getting paid.  
> I just know when I'm getting one, the other's getting away.  
> _-- Kanye Omari West_

## Footnotes

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
